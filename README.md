# MetaNet - ALPHA

Decentralized, distributed and censorship resistant forums/commenting. MetaNet combines the open-source power of distributed websearch, file sharing and security.

#### How it works

Forums are categorized by a tag in any webpage's metadata. 
anyone else can write a response on their own website with an identifier in the metadata linking the response to the original post. Popular pages are saved by readers and served to new readers by them. A distributed search engine is used to browse content instead of a central database.
