# MetaNet
Decentralized Forums and Commenting

## The idea is decentralized forums that work with the help of metadata and any search engine.

Our recommended CMS is Wordpress and our recommended search engine is the open source and distributed Yacy Search

### Forums
Forums can be categorized by a tag in a webpage's metadata (like a hashtag).
Everyone can post to any forum simply by creating a page with text and adding the appropriate tag to the pages metadata (#cars #pets #jobs #movies #questions ....) 

Instead of having to browse a centralized forum, we can search for a "hashtag" and order the results by date. The results should show posts and responses by everyone while eliminating spammers since the search engine will be less likely to index posts with low value.

### Responses and comments
To respond to a "forum post" of this kind anyone else can write a response on their own website with the same forum tag in the metadata and also an identifier in the metadata linking the response to the original post (perhaps the url of the original post). 

### Following
To "follow" someone we can use good old RSS or Atom feeds that seem to be very under appreciated lately.

This approach provides decentralized and censorship resistant forums with already existing tools instead of requiring the development specialized software such as Diaspora, Steem, GNUsocial and other decentralized social networking projects. 

The main difficulty will be for a large enough group to agree on how exactly to tag posts and responses in the metadata.
