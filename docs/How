### Forums
Forums are categorized by a tag in a webpage's metadata.
Everyone can post to any forum simply by creating a page with text on their own site and adding the appropriate tag to the pages metadata (for example: #questions #cars #pets #jobs #movies ....) 

Instead of having to browse a centralized forum, we can search for a meta tag and order the results by date. The results should show posts and responses by everyone while eliminating spammers since the search engine will be less likely to index posts with low value.

### Responses and comments
To respond to a "forum post" of this kind anyone else can write a response on their own website with an identifier in the metadata linking the response to the original post. 

### Following
To "follow" someone we can use good old RSS or Atom feeds.
